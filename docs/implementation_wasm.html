<h1 class="title">The Lobster WASM code generator implementation</h1>
</header>
<p>NOTE: this document contains detail on how code generation for the WebAssembly backend works internally, if you just want to USE this backend, please read the sections on WebAssembly <a href="implementation.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-the-backend">Structure of the backend</h2>
<p>Lobster is structured such that the front-end outputs Lobster bytecode, which sits in a FlatBuffer file together with all its metadata. That file is stand-alone (does not need any further information from the front-end or source code) and can be interpreted by the VM directly, or passed to any of the native code backends, currently C++ and WebAssembly.</p>
<p>The backend is layered in these 3 files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tonative.cpp</code> is shared between all native code backends. It parses the Lobster bytecode and tracks information needed by any backend, then calls into the specific backend through an interface defined in <code>tonative.h</code>.</li>
<li><code>towasm.cpp</code> implements that interface, and does all the Lobster-specific work of generating wasm code.</li>
<li><code>wasm_binary_writer.h</code> is a utility class that does all the heavy lifting of actually generating a valid wasm module. It is written such that it is entirely independent of the rest of the Lobster code base, and depends only on a few STL containers, to ensure it can easily be adopted by others wishing to emit wasm. It contains functionality for low level encoding (LEBs etc), emitting sections, individual instructions, and importantly, linking and relocation information.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-of-the-binary-writer">Design of the binary writer</h2>
<p>Most languages, like Lobster, come with a runtime in C or C++ that you wouldn't want to translate to wasm by hand (or worse, emit instruction by instruction from a backend), so it is imporant that generated wasm code can be linked correctly against a runtime compiled to object files by the C/C++ compiler. In this case we're piggy-backing on Clang, LLD and Binaryen as used in the Emscripten toolchain.</p>
<p>This means generating a wasm module with linking information, and supplying the right relocations. Many instructions in wasm refer to functions and other things by index, but the linker has to merge many such index spaces into the final module, which means renumbering all of these indices. Luckily, the binary writer takes care of all this automatically, and allows us the generate code as-if we're the only ones.</p>
<h3 id="streaming-interface.">Streaming interface.</h3>
<p>The binary writer is a &quot;streaming&quot; API (as opposed to an object API), meaning that it immediately writes out the wasm module data with no or few intermediary data structures. This has the advantage that it is low in memory usage and is very fast, with the downside being that most things have to be supplied to it in order. This should not be very difficult for most code generators, however.</p>
<p>A wasm module should contain sections in order, and the API enforces this same order:</p>
<pre><code>Type     1    Function signature declarations
Import   2    Import declarations
Function 3    Function declarations
Table    4    Indirect function table and other tables
Memory   5    Memory attributes
Global   6    Global declarations
Export   7    Exports
Start    8    Start function declaration
Element  9    Elements section
Code    10    Function bodies (code)
Data    11    Data segments</code></pre>
<p>What is not shown here is custom sections, which may appear before and after each of these sections. One such custom section is the linking section, which appears at the end of all of the above. Its contents is generated automatically by the binary writer as a consequence of all the things emitted in the above section (primarily the Code section).</p>
<h3 id="simple-example.">Simple example.</h3>
<p>A minimal usage of the API, where we generate code for &quot;hello world&quot;, assuming the printing function is in the runtime.</p>
<p>Note that this assumes a minimum familiarity with wasm in general. I am not going to explain the &quot;why&quot; of this design, if you end up using this API then reading up on the wasm module format would be useful.</p>

<h3 id="the-lobster-generator.">The Lobster generator.</h3>
<p>A more complex example using the binary writer is the Lobster generator in <code>towasm.cpp</code>, which follows the same pattern as the above simple example. Because it is being driven by calls from <code>tonative.cpp</code> it is in separate functions, but these functions are in the order of being called, so should be easy to follow.</p>
<p>In terms of imports, it imports one function for each of Lobsters bytecodes, which means a Lobster bytecode can be directly mapped to a function id. Then there are a couple of additional functions in the runtime it needs, most importantly <code>EngineRunCompiledCodeMain</code> which it calls with the starting compiled function, such that runtime can initialize itself and then call back into the Lobster compiled code. This structure was chosen such that the maximum amount of code can live in the runtime, and the minimum needs to be explicitly generated.</p>
<p>It generates Lobster code not on a per function basis, but per basic block. This is because Lobster has more complicated control flow features (such as non-local returns and co-routines) which (at the time of writing) wasm can't support natively. So it uses a &quot;trampoline&quot; system where each basic block returns the function address of the next basic block it wants to go to. Some of these transitions can be optimized, but in the most general case this has to be an indirect jump.</p>
<p>The actual instructions generated are pretty simple, with it mostly emitting a call per VM instruction, with the exception of control flow operations which have more special purpose implementation.</p>
<p>(to be expanded)</p>
