<p>The Lobster Type System</p>
<p>This document is about how to make most effective use of the type system..</p>
<h2 id="state-of-the-type-checker">State of the Type Checker</h2>
<p>The type checker is now the only way to write Lobster code, even though it only just excited &quot;beta&quot; state. There may be rough edges. If after reading this document you still don't understand why you're getting type errors, contact me and I see if I can improve the compiler or the documentation. If the VM crashes due to a type related error, definitely contact me.</p>
<h2 id="the-nature-of-the-type-system">The nature of the type system</h2>
<p>Lobster was originally dynamically typed. Not only is this easier to implement, it bring tremendous expressive power &quot;for free&quot;, particularly in the way it allows you to write generic code which often requires arcane typing annotations in static languages. The downsides are obvious too: type errors come late or stay hidden, and execution speed suffers.</p>
<p>The type system in Lobster attempts to achieve the best of both worlds, with a type system that retains as much as possible of the dynamic style of writing (little to no type annotations needed, while able to type check a much broader range of code than other languages). It achieves this by using 3 techniques that build on eachother:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Type Inference</strong>. A well known technique by now, as many language employ it one way or another, and it is an obvious way to reduce type annotations. By itself it is rather restrictive however, as it is limited in the kind of generic code it can correctly type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specialization</strong>. Instead of struggling to infer or define generic types for everything, we specialize functions to the exact parameter types they are called with. This allows a much wider range of possible code inside generic functions, since they are only ever type-checked with specific types. This of course requires there to be multiple copies of functions, but in practice the code expansion is minimal. Specialized code can be optimized and inlined more aggressively, resulting in significant speed advantages besides the expressivity gains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flow Based</strong>: Type checking happens in order of function calls, i.e. it is much like evaluating the code, but with types instead of values. This means that when type checking a particular function, it not just knows the exact types of parameters (thanks to specialization), but also the types of free variables, and it knows its callers (a compile time call stack). This means that when a type error happens, you can see in what context the wrong type got created and passed down. Think of it as an earlier dynamic type error. In addition, it takes into account the state of conditional statements, allowing you to avoid unnecessary type errors.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, you are less constrained in the kind kind of code you can write that still type checks correctly, while using less annotations. But with great power comes great responsibility: the less annotations you write, the more a compile time error indeed looks like a run-time error: they are almost as hard to track down. It is certainly easy to start with no annotations, and then gradually add them in places to force type errors to come earlier and be easier to understand. Find your own trade-off.</p>
<h2 id="writing-generic-code">Writing generic code</h2>
<p>In the simplest cases, there is no difference between writing dynamically typed code and typed code. For example a simple function like:</p>
<pre><code>def add(x, y): x + y</code></pre>
<p>is how you create a generic functions in either case. You create a generic parameter by.. not specifying a type!</p>
<p>Now this is already a non-trivial example that will trip up many languages with type inference, since you cannot have the arguments be generic unless the <code>+</code> operation is defined on them, requiring them to have a way to specify the set of types that have this operation specified (see e.g. type classes in Haskell), or simply not allowing it at all (see e.g. generics in Java).</p>
<p>Lobster does not have this problem, since it simply type checks a copy of <code>add</code> for each combination of types it is called with. This then deals correctly with allowing to write <code>add(&quot;number: &quot;, 4)</code>, taking care of converting <code>4</code> to a string and calling string concatenation on the result, without making simpler cases like <code>add(1, 2)</code> slower because of type inspection. In fact, the opportunities for statically optimizing these operations are now greatly increased. This is very similar to C++ templates, but without the clunky syntax.</p>
<h2 id="the-trouble-with-nil">The trouble with nil</h2>
<p>So far, the type system tries to preserve as much freedom of dynamic typing as possible. One area where it is however <em>more</em> strict than most existing languages is how it deals with <code>nil</code>.</p>
<p><code>nil</code> (or <code>null</code> in other languages) is usually a default value of all reference types, which is very convenient in expressing uninitialized or optional values. But this convenience comes at a high cost: if you forget to check for <code>nil</code> before you access a value, your program may terminate with a run-time error. Very often we know a value cannot be <code>nil</code>, but we cannot guarantee this, or are lazy to do so. Result: random errors popping up in random places. Not good.</p>
<p>Lobster takes the obvious approach: <code>nil</code> is a separate type that is <em>not a valid value</em> of a reference type. You may still create &quot;nilable&quot; types, but these cannot be accessed (e.g. dereferenced) unless they are first converted to their underlying type:</p>
<pre><code>a := nil      // a is a nilable of unknown type
if(..):
    a = &quot;foo&quot; // a is a nilable string
a += &quot;bar&quot;    // error: + not defined for nil
if(a):        // guaranteed not be nil inside block
    a += &quot;!&quot;  // ok: a is of type string here</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can use conditionals to guard code that wants to access a nilable. This seems like a hassle maybe, but think of the benefit: you will never see a <code>nil</code> related run-time error <em>ever again</em>.</p>
<p>And now that <code>nil</code> is a separate type, we can improve our code by not using <code>nil</code> unless absolutely necessary. Many uses of <code>nil</code> in legacy code are lazy, and can be avoided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If at all possible, try to reorder code such that variables can be initialized to a valid value right where they are defined. This is often possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If the variable cannot be initialized where it must be defined, see if there's a &quot;empty&quot; version of the reference type that the variable can be initialized with, such as an empty vector or string, or a struct filled with zeroes, that has a benign effect when used.</p></li>
<li><p>If you must start with <code>nil</code>, try to have the if-check for it as early on as possible, so all code deeper down the call chain can benefit from a non-nil type that doesn't need to be checked.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The flow based analysis generally understand logical expressions, so if you write <code>if(!a):</code> instead, you'll be able to access <code>a</code> in the <code>else</code> block, but not in the <code>then</code> block. Similarly, if you write <code>if (a &amp; f(a)):</code> then <code>a</code> is available as non-nil both as argument to <code>f</code> <em>and</em> in the following block.</p>
<p>De-referencing nillables as in <code>o &amp; o.f</code> is so common that there's a shorthand for it: <code>o?.f</code> (which can be chained). As useful as this looks, note that you are just passing on the problem, as the result of such an expression is again a nilable type. As such, this is best used inside conditionals or as statements where the result is not needed.</p>
<p><code>?</code> is generally the way to indicate a nilable type, e.g. <code>string?</code> is a nilable string.</p>
<p>One more thing to notice about <code>nil</code> is that it only knows what exact nilable type it represents once it comes &quot;in contact with&quot; its reference type. That means that if you tried to access <code>a</code> right after it was defined, it would have still have type <code>nil</code> rather than <code>string?</code>. Similarly, if you tried to assign a vector to <code>a</code> after the first assignment, it would complain that only a <code>string?</code> is valid, i.e. a <code>string</code> or <code>nil</code> value.</p>
<p>To bypass that process and force <code>nil</code> to represent a particular nilable type, you can attach a type, like <code>nil:string</code>, which creates a value of type <code>string?</code>. Alternatively you could write <code>nil &amp; a</code>, which makes <code>nil</code> have the type of whatever <code>a</code> has, which may be a generic variable. Similarly, <code>a | nil</code> has the same nilable type, but now the value is actually <code>a</code> rather than <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h2 id="more-flow-based-types">More flow based types</h2>
<p>As we saw with <code>nil</code>, a variable may have a different type in certain parts of the code, thanks to the information that a conditional provides.</p>
<p>Another example of this is the <code>is</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>if(a is xyz): a.x</code></pre>
<p>We can access fields of <code>xyz</code> regardless of what type <code>a</code> had outside this scope.</p>
<p>Assignment can work similar to conditionals:</p>
<pre><code>a := nil
if(..): a = xyz_0
a.x        // error
a = xyz_0  // a is guaranteed non-nil below
a.x        // ok</code></pre>
<p>Note how there are two different cases here: with an assignment inside a conditional, the type checker has to be conservative, and can't guarantee the value is non-nil. But with an un-conditional assignment, we can change the type of <code>a</code> for the rest of the block.</p>
<p>An additional way is to use <code>assert</code>. Use this when you know for sure a value must be non-nil or have a particular type, but you can't structure your code such that this is already obvious to the type system.</p>
<h2 id="compile-time-if-thens.">Compile-time if-then's.</h2>
<p>The flow-based type-checking above gives branches more specific types. But we can do even better: if the condition is statically known, we can avoid type-checking alltogether:</p>
<pre><code>def compile_time_if(x):
    if(x is int | x is float):
        1 / x
    else:
        x
assert(compile_time_if(1) is int)
assert(compile_time_if(&quot;&quot;) is string)</code></pre>
<p>The division would be a type error if x is a string, but it compiles anyway since this if is compile-time constant, and the type checker ignores this branch.</p>
<p>If you're used to dynamic languages, you might think: what's the fuss? This would be a compile error in almost all statically typed languages, since they don't cull code before the optimizer. For example with C++ templates can't handle this situation, and that's already more powerful than most forms of generics.</p>
<p>Also note the return type is just the else branch in the string case, it doesn't need to make a type union between the branches anymore.</p>
<p>This is powerful, because it allows you to write generic functions that do subtly different things depending on the input, with no overhead from the conditional, and the ability to operate differently on each case.</p>
<p>You can do something similar with multi-methods, but that may require more code or may be less efficient.</p>
<h2 id="generic-objects">Generic objects</h2>
<p>Besides functions, objects can also be generic. If you define any field without types:</p>
<pre><code>struct foo: [ a:string, b ]</code></pre>
<p>You create a generic type.</p>
<p>Unlike functions however, Lobster is a bit more strict here in that it requires you to explicitly define a specialization before you can use it<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre><code>struct foo_f: foo(float)</code></pre>
<p>You can now construct a foo with floats, either explicitly with <code>foo_f { &quot;hi&quot;, 2.0 }</code>, or you can use the generic type: <code>foo { &quot;hi&quot;, 2.0 }</code> and let the compiler pick from all available specializations.</p>
<p>Functions written to accept <code>foo</code> arguments will of course work on any of the specializations.</p>
<p>You can even specialize and subclass at the same time:</p>
<pre><code>struct bar : foo { c }
struct bar : foo(float) { c:int }</code></pre>
<p>The first version subclasses <code>foo</code> into another generic type, and the second specializes and subclasses at the same time, creating a non-generic type instead.</p>
