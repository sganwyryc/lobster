Using the compiler
------------------

Using Lobster from the [command line][3], or setting up editors such as [Sublime

Learning the language
---------------------

If you already know how to program in at least one C-style language
(C/C++/C\#/Java/JavaScript/PHP etc), then a way to get a quick idea of where
Lobster is different is by looking at the [C-style language Cheat Sheet][6].

[6]: <C_style%20language%20Cheat%20Sheet%20for%20Lobster.html>

Useful for reference: [all builtin functions][7] (this part of the documentation
is auto-generated by the compiler).

[7]: <builtin_functions_reference.html>

Tutorials: How to [build a 2D shooter][8] step by step in Lobster.

[8]: <shooter_tutorial.html>

To learn the language more in-depth: The [language reference][9]. Check out the
[style guide][10] before you write lots of code :) Read about the [type
system][11].

Building Lobster
----------------

Read about the [implementation][12] to be able to compile, extend or use Lobster
for your own C++ projects.
